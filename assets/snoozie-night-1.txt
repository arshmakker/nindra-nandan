(1–2 seconds of silence)

Hi.

This is just a short message.
You don't need to do anything.
You can stop listening at any time.

(pause)

If you're here, it probably means the night feels a little longer than usual.
And that's okay.

You don't have to fix anything right now.
You don't have to fall asleep.
You don't even have to feel calm.

You're allowed to just be here.

(pause)

For the next few moments, there's nothing you need to figure out.
Nothing you need to respond to.
Nothing you need to get right.

If thoughts show up, that's fine.
If they drift away, that's fine too.

(pause)

You can let your body rest in whatever way feels easiest.
Not better.
Not deeper.
Just easier.

(slow pause)

This moment doesn't need an outcome.
It doesn't need progress.

It's enough to stay for a bit.

(pause)

If at any point you want to stop, you can.
If you want to keep listening, that's okay too.

I'll stay quiet now.

(3–4 seconds of silence)
